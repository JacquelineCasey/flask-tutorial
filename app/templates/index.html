    This site is used for testing various Heroku and Flask features
    that might make it into other projects. Navigate to some other

      <td>
        To show off how a page might use HTML and link to other pages. Also finds
        and uses a very simple CSS stylesheet.

    <tr>
      <td> <a href="/sample"> eflask-app-067.herokuapp.com/sample </a> </td>
      <td>
        A Page to link to, which also uses HTML.
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td> <a href="/deprecated"> eflask-app-067.herokuapp.com/deprecated </a> </td>
      <td>
        Another page to link to. This one is coded slightly differently, sending
        text directly instead of rendering an HTML file. 
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td> <a href="/environment">eflask-app-067.herokuapp.com/environment</a> </td>
      <td>
        This page asks the app to read an environment variable, and it says 
        something different depending on if this is running locally (on my macbook),
        or on Heroku. This is good for hiding something (ie a password or a database key)
        from prying eyes.
